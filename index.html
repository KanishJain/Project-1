    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Bean is often portrayed as a buffoon.
       He is obnoxious, crazy and sometimes seems stupid.
        Mr. Bean rarely speaks and when he does, only a mumbling voice comes out.
         He doesn't show much care to his girlfriend which was proven in many episodes (live-action and animated).
         Mr. Bean often pretends his teddy is real but he doesn't always treat Teddy nicely.
        Mr. Bean is also a pain to the Reliant Regal in loads of episodes becoming a running gag in the series.
       In a few occasions, Mr. Bean had been a bit kind but he rarely shows it.
      He also tends to hate Irma kissing him.

    <h2>Teddy</h2>
    <p>
      Teddy is Mr. Bean's teddy bear and, apparently, best friend.
       This little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs which invariably end up broken
        in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate,
         Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive: he always buys it a Christmas present or tries not to wake it up in the morning.
         For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotizes Teddy, he snaps his fingers and the bear's head falls backwards as if it had fallen asleep instantly.
        (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy's head up.) Teddy is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies;
       it has been decapitated ("Mr. Bean in Room 426"), used as his paint brush ("Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean") and shrunk in the wash ("Tee Off, Mr. Bean").
      Teddy is also Mr. Bean's "pet" in "Hair by Mr. Bean of London" where he is used to win a pet show.

      Over the years, Teddy has undergone several changes. When it debuted on "The Trouble with Mr. Bean", it had a smaller head.
       Two episodes later, its head reached its current size but its "eyes" were not present until Bean placed gold thumb tacks on its face.
      The "eyes" have since been replaced with two small white buttons sewn over Teddy's face, giving it a distinctive image.

       After filming ended, Teddy was donated by Atkinson to Gyles Brandreth's Teddy bear museum in Stratford-upon-Avon.
       In 2008 upon the museum's closing, Teddy was sold at auction for £180.

    <h2>Style</h2>
    <p>
      Best known for his use of physical comedy in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more on language.
       Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely deadpan delivery.
        One of his better-known comic devices is over-articulation of the "B" sound, such as his pronunciation of "Bob" in the Blackadder II episode "Bells".
         Atkinson has a stammer,and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.
          Atkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of Buster Keaton,sets him apart from most modern television and film comics,
         who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues.
        This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called "the man with the rubber face"; 
       comedic reference was made to this in an episode of Blackadder the Third ("Sense and Senility"), 
      in which Baldrick (Tony Robinson) refers to his master, Mr. E. Blackadder, as a "lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard".

    <h2>Retirement</h2>
    <p>
      In November 2012, it emerged that Rowan Atkinson intended to retire Mr. Bean.
       "The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me – basically quite physical, quite childish –
         I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of," Atkinson told The Daily Telegraph's Review. 
          "Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad.
           You've got to be careful."He has also said that the role typecast him to a degree.
            Despite these comments, Atkinson said in 2016 that he would never retire the character of Mr. Bean.
           In October 2014, Atkinson also appeared as Mr. Bean in a TV advert for Snickers.
          In 2015, he starred alongside Ben Miller and Rebecca Front in a sketch for BBC Red Nose Day in which Mr. Bean attends a funeral.
         In 2017, he appeared as Mr. Bean in the Chinese film Huan Le Xi Ju Ren.
        In October 2018, Atkinson (as Mr. Bean) received YouTube's Diamond Play Button for his channel surpassing 10 million subscribers on the video platform.
      Among the most-watched channels in the world, in 2018 it had more than 6.5 billion views.
